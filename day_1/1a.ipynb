It applies software development principles to agent creation, allowing developers to define agent logic, tools, and orchestration directly in code. ADK aims to make agent development feel more like traditional software development, emphasizing control, testability, and versioning. While optimized for Google's Gemini models and ecosystem, ADK is model-agnostic and compatible with other frameworks.\n",
